				<p><br><br>Few medical-legal topics have generated as much discussion as the subject
of medical record documentation. Liability insurers, defense attorneys,
and third-party payers remind physicians and other health professionals
that the safety of patients, the outcome of litigation and the promptness of
reimbursement depend on the adequacy, legibility, completeness, timeliness
and accuracy of medical records.

Many malpractice claims result in a victory for the plaintiff because of the
poor quality of medical records, even in cases in which appropriate medical
care was provided. Maintaining adequate, defensible medical records
need not be a chore.  But, physicians whose inadequate records were partly responsible for
their involvement in litigation can attest to the fact that the amount of time
spent in deposition, meeting with legal counsel, worrying about the case
and its effect on their personal life and professional reputation, or preparing
for and attending trial far exceeds the time it takes to maintain adequate
medical records. </p>
