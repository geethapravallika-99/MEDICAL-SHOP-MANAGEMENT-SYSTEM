			<h1>Our Medical Store Details</h1>
					<p>A significant portion of risk management advice regarding documentation unfortunately 
                                            boils down to the injunction, “You physicians ought to write more.” From my years in 
                                            the medicolegal field, I have found that this advice not only fails to be useful,
                                            but is actually counter-productive: faced with excessive demands for documentation,
                                            many clinicians dig in their heels and refrain from writing at all or from writing
                                            down even relevant data.                                  
Writing more is not the solution; simply writing with greater efficiency
will cut down on time spent in documentation. The key to this approach is to keep 
in mind the three sovereign principles of documentation, which also closely resemble 
the three principles of medical decision analysis.</p>
			
			<h1>Medicines Details</h1>
					
					<p>Few medical-legal topics have generated as much discussion as the subject
of medical record documentation. Liability insurers, defense attorneys,
and third-party payers remind physicians and other health professionals
that the safety of patients, the outcome of litigation and the promptness of
reimbursement depend on the adequacy, legibility, completeness, timeliness
and accuracy of medical records.

Many malpractice claims result in a victory for the plaintiff because of the
poor quality of medical records, even in cases in which appropriate medical
care was provided. Maintaining adequate, defensible medical records
need not be a chore.  But, physicians whose inadequate records were partly responsible for
their involvement in litigation can attest to the fact that the amount of time
spent in deposition, meeting with legal counsel, worrying about the case
and its effect on their personal life and professional reputation, or preparing
for and attending trial far exceeds the time it takes to maintain adequate
medical records. </p>
